# CleanData_PeerAssessment1
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project


## Project Description

This project is part of a course [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-012) from Coursera and the Johns Hopkins University.

## Details

In the file CodeBook.md describe the data generated on the file tidy_data.txt that is build with the script run_analsys.R.

The script fullfil the following objectives:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

To process all data and build the clean data set you only need to call run_analysis.R.

This script download the original data file, process all the data and generate tidy_data.txt with a resume of the main features for each activity and subject.
